			<h1>ABOUT ASHLEY</h1>
			<p>Regional Australia isn't the first place you'd think a young designer would come from, but it was home for most of my life.
			I have been a designer since 2012, designing event posters and promotional material for the local council. Since my debut
			I've been designing for a range of clients including Twisted Plastic Records in conjunction with Ministry of Sound, FReeZA,
			Wyndham City Council, Corangamite Shire, Igaz Sound & Lighting, and Dark Tempo Warrnambool. Many of these clients broadened
			my range in services, pushing me to design logos, posters, tickets, brochures, business cards and much more.<br>
			<br>
			Since the beginning of Maddox Designs, I have acquired a Certificate III in Media, a Diploma of Graphic Design, and I am currently
			studying for a Bachelor of Communication Design. Print Design and Motion Graphics are favourites of mine, although I am confident
			and willing to experiment with Web Design and Illustration. With a bit of technology and a lot of music, I am in my element and
			always excited to begin a new project.</p>
